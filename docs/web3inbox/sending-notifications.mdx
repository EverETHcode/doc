# Sending Notifications

Once an account is subscribed to your app's notifications you can test sending notifications to the account.

We recommend testing receiving notifications at [app.web3inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com).

To experience native push notifications, you can try one of our sample wallets:

- [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
- [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

## Authentication

To send a notification, you will need your `notify_api_secret` which you can find under the Secrets section of your project on [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com). This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

You will also need your project ID.

## Sending

Accounts are identified by their [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) format.
