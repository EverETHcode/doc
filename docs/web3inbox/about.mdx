# Introduction

:::caution
Web3Inbox is in alpha development
:::

The Web3Inbox SDK provides a toolkit for integrating web3 notification features into dapps. It utilizes WalletConnect's Notify API to support app notifications, enhancing user interaction and feature availability.

Notify is designed for web3 scenarios, providing event-based notifications for activities like DAO votes, DeFi transaction alerts, and updates for NFT holders.

## QuickStart

<Wrapper
  type="large"
  style={{
    marginTop: '2rem'
  }}
  items={[
    {
      name: 'Core Components',
      description: 'For a fully-customized Web3Inbox experience.',
      icon: w3iLogo,
      href: './core-components/about'
    }
  ]}
/>

## Use Cases

### Dapp Notifications

Dapps can send web3-native messages directly to wallets with device push notifications. Reach users instantly with real-time notifications such as DAO proposals, token launches, NFT drops, and more.

## Features

Some of the key features of the Web3Inbox SDK include:

- **E2E encryption:** Messages that run through the WalletConnect protocol are end-to-end encrypted, always.
- **Device push notifications:** Push notifications to the user's native wallet.
- **Notifications history:** Messages are stored and can be accessed from any device.
- **Spam protection/subscription control.**

## How do users receive notifications?

Users can subscribe to and receive notifications in several ways:
- Natively in their wallet if the wallet supports the Web3Inbox SDK.
  - You can also test this with one of our sample wallets:
    - [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
    - [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)
- In your app's frontend using [Core Components](core-components/about)
- In [Web3Inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com) App

## Getting Started

Web3Inbox can be added to your app in a few steps:

- [Setup your domain](setup) to send authenticated notifications.
