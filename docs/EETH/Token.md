Dividend Mechanism

- An EETH Dividend contract tracks EETH holdings and ETH dividends
- When a user buys EETH, they are minted an equal number of tracking tokens
- Tracking tokens represent a user's share of dividends
- Revenue from EverETH products is accumulated in the Dividend Tracker
- EETH holders can claim ETH dividends proportional to their share of
tracking tokens
- Dividend claims are subject to vesting periods to prevent dividend
sniping

suggest/vote on new proposals. Governance powers include:
- Voting on adding new products or services
