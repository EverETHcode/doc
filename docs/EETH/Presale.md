*The snapshot holders presale is a special early access token sale event for dedicated members of
our community. A snapshot was taken of wallet addresses holding our EverETH Reflect token. Wallet
addresses on this snapshot have been whitelisted and given priority access to purchase EETH tokens
at a discounted presale price before the main public presale opened.

**The public sale is the main token sale event open to the general public. Anyone can participate by
purchasing EETH tokens during the public presale, while supplies last. There will be a limited number
of tokens available at the public presale price, with every stage passed the price to be increased.
Before participating in the EETH presale, please conduct your own research, review the Terms Of Use ,
Risk Discalimer , the Whitepaper and make an informed decision.
