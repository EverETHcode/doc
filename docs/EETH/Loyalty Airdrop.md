Loyalty Periods:

Day 1 - 90: 0.03% daily  
Day 91 - 180: 0.0375% daily
Day 181 - 270: 0.046875% daily 
Day 271 - 360: 0.05859375% daily

The longer you hold, the higher the loyalty airdrop rate increases over time. This incentivizes long-term holding and rewards loyal holders.

The loyalty airdrop applies to all tokens held. If you acquire more tokens, the new tokens start earning at the current loyalty rate.

To receive the loyalty airdrop, holders must manually claim the accrued rewards every 90 days. This allows you to control when rewards are claimed.

Examples:

- If you hold 100 tokens for 120 days, you would earn: 
   - 0.03% of 100 tokens for 90 days = 2.7 tokens
   - Claim 2.7 token loyalty airdrop on day 90
- 0.0375% of 100 tokens for next 30 days = 1.125 tokens 
   - Claim additional 1.125 token loyalty airdrop on day 120

- If you hold 50 tokens for 180 days and acquire 100 more tokens on day 120, you would earn:
   - 50 tokens: Claim 3.825 token loyalty airdrop on day 90 and day 180
   - 100 tokens: Claim 2.25 token loyalty airdrop on day 180
   - Total loyalty airdrops = 6.075 tokens

The loyalty airdrop rewards long-term holders and gives incentive to continue holding. The longer you hold, the higher the rewards.

The percentages are subject to change. The airdrop program can be adjusted or canceled by EverETH DAO by vote.
