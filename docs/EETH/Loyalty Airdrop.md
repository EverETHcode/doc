Loyalty Periods:  

Day 1 - 90: 0.03% daily
Day 91 - 180: 0.0375% daily  
Day 181 - 270: 0.046875% daily
Day 271 - 360: 0.05859375% daily

The longer you hold, the higher the loyalty rewards rate increases over time. This incentivizes long-term holding and rewards loyal holders. 

The loyalty rewards apply to all tokens held. If you acquire more tokens, the new tokens start earning at the current loyalty rate.

To receive the loyalty rewards, holders must manually claim the accrued rewards every 90 days. This allows you to control when rewards are claimed.

Examples:

- If you hold 100 tokens for 120 days, you would earn:
  - 0.03% of 100 tokens for 90 days = 2.7 tokens
  - Claim 2.7 token loyalty reward on day 90
  - 0.0375% of 100 tokens for next 30 days = 1.125 tokens
  - Claim additional 1.125 token loyalty reward on day 120

- If you hold 50 tokens for 180 days and acquire 100 more tokens on day 120, you would earn: 
  - 50 tokens: Claim 3.825 token loyalty reward on day 90 and day 180
  - 100 tokens: Claim 2.25 token loyalty reward on day 180
  - Total loyalty rewards = 6.075 tokens  

The loyalty rewards program incentivizes long-term holding and rewards loyal holders. The longer you hold, the higher the rewards.
