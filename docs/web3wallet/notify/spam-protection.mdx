# Spam Protection

To ensure a positive end-user experience, it's essential to protect users and wallets from spam. This document outlines the measures we have taken and plan to implement to enable this.

1. The most basic security measure taken is an explicit opt-in process to only allow notifications from apps that a user has requested. This uses a SIWE message and works as follows:
    - The client generates an private keypair for that device
    - The client generates a CAIP-122 (SIWE) message that authorizes the keypair to control subscriptions for a specific app (or in the case of a wallet, all apps) for the user's account. The user then signs this message with their wallet. We call this an [Identity Key](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/identity/identity-keys).
    - The client then uses the Identity Key to sign requests to create, read, update, or delete notification subscriptions.
2. The opt-in process allows the user to customise which notification types they'd like to receive from the app (e.g. promptional, transactional, etc.). The user can change these at any time. The user can also opt-out at any time by unsubscribing from the app, or editing their OS notification preferences to ignore notifications from that particular app (assuming wallet implements this).
3. Notifications from an app to an account are limited to once per hour, with bursts of up to 5 notifications using the leaky bucket algorithm.

We are also working on some more advanced spam mitigation strategies including publisher scoring based on heuristics such as open rate and manually reported spam complaints.
