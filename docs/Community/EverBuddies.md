Almost unnoticed by our community, the EverETH project is being professionalized in the background. In addition to the technical development of various tools, the focus is also on strengthening our community in order to drive adoption and success for the EverETH.

To do this with united forces, we are building an organizational form for our collaboration with a top-down approach that can accommodate a rapidly growing community with more and more helpers in the future. To this end, in addition to the core team, we are currently forming a cohesive group of our most loyal token holders and closest allies - the EverBuddies. ü§ù

In the future, this group will play a crucial role in publicizing EverETH, defining and promoting the common spirit of the project and benefiting from various advantages, which we will only briefly outline here. It will bring us all personally closer together as a group, for the benefit of our project.
