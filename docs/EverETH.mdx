EverETH aims to become a leading innovator and
creator of decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols on the
Ethereum blockchain.

EETH holders will receive dividends from the revenue generated by
EverETH's products and services. The dividends will be paid in ETH to
EETH token holders based on their proportional share of the total EETH
supply.

Products and Services

EverETH plans to launch several signature protocols and dApps that will
generate revenue and value for EETH holders:
- The very first product “EverETH Reflect” is already live on Binance Smart
Chain since 2021.

Under development:

- Liquid Staking Protocol: A liquid staking solution that allows ETH holders
to earn staking rewards without locking up their ETH. Users pay a fee to
the protocol, which gets distributed to EETH holders.
- Marketplace: A marketplace for buying/selling physical or digital assets.
The marketplace charges a premium fee on transactions, which is
distributed to the dividend contract.
- DeFi Yield Aggregator: An aggregator that allows users to invest in
multiple DeFi protocols from one platform. Aggregator fees are sent to the
EETH dividend contract.
- More products and services to be announced.

EETH Token

- ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain
- Used for governance voting, transfers, and access to dividends
- Total supply: 1 billion
- Distribution: TBA

Dividend Mechanism

- An EETH Dividend contract tracks EETH holdings and ETH dividends
- When a user buys EETH, they are minted an equal number of tracking
tokens
- Tracking tokens represent a user's share of dividends
- Revenue from EverETH products is accumulated in the Dividend Tracker
- EETH holders can claim ETH dividends proportional to their share of
tracking tokens
- Dividend claims are subject to vesting periods to prevent dividend
sniping

Governance
EETH holders can participate in governing the EverETH project and
suggest/vote on new proposals. Governance powers include:
- Voting on adding new products or services
- Allocating project funds or revenue
- Changing platform parameters and fees
- Upgrading smart contracts
- Other administrative powers
