## Products and Services

EverETH plans to launch several signature protocols and dApps that will
generate revenue and value for EETH holders and the Ethereum community:
- The very first product “EverETH Reflect” is already live on Binance Smart
Chain since 2021.

## Under development:

- Liquid Staking Protocol: A liquid staking solution that allows ETH holders
to earn staking rewards without locking up their ETH. Users pay a fee to
the protocol, which gets distributed to EETH holders.
- Marketplace: A marketplace for buying/selling physical or digital assets.
The marketplace charges a premium fee on transactions, which is
distributed to the dividend contract.
- DeFi Yield Aggregator: An aggregator that allows users to invest in
multiple DeFi protocols from one platform. Aggregator fees are sent to the
EETH dividend contract.
- More products and services to be announced.

## EETH Token

- ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain
- Used for governance voting, transfers, and access to dividends
- Total supply: 1 billion
- Distribution: https://docs.evereth.net/EETH/Token

## Dividend Mechanism

- An EETH Dividend contract tracks EETH holdings and ETH dividends
- When a user buys EETH, they are minted an equal number of tracking
tokens
- Tracking tokens represent a user's share of dividends
- Revenue from EverETH products is accumulated in the Dividend Tracker
- EETH holders can claim ETH dividends proportional to their share of
tracking tokens
- Dividend claims are subject to vesting periods to prevent dividend
sniping.
