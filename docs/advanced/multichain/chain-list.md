# Chain List

This is an active list of all the known and registered chains that have been configured to work within the WalletConnect Ecosystem. If your chain is missing and you would like to have it added, you can do so by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+new+chain+request&template=new_chain_to_explorer.md&title=). 

:::info Note 
To register a chain, you must know both its native representation (the chainID used with that kind of blockchain) *and* its Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance representation, which can be found reading the relevant CAIP-2 profiles on the [CASA Namespaces Project Docs](https://namespaces.chainagnostic.org/).
