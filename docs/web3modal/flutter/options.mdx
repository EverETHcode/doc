# Usage

:::caution
**The Web3Modal SDK for Flutter is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

It's public API and associated documentation may still see significant and breaking changes.

## Web3App or projectId & PairingMetadata (required)

You must provide either a Web3App or a projectId as well as a PairingMetadata in both cases.
Providing the `Web3App` instance lets you register callbacks on the `Web3App` you'd like to use.
Otherwise, we recommend just providing the projectId and `PairingMetadata` to the `W3MService` directly.

#### W3MService with Web3App:

```dart
final _web3App = await Web3App.createInstance(
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Flutter Dapp Example',
    description: 'Flutter Dapp Example',
    url: 'https://www.walletconnect.com/',
    icons: ['https://walletconnect.com/walletconnect-logo.png'],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'flutterdapp://',
      universal: 'https://www.walletconnect.com',
    ),
  ),
);

// Register callbacks on the Web3App you'd like to use

final _w3mService = W3MService(web3App: _web3App);
```

#### W3MService with Project ID:

```dart
final _w3mService = W3MService(
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}', 
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Flutter Dapp Example',
    description: 'Flutter Dapp Example',
    url: 'https://www.walletconnect.com/',
    icons: ['https://walletconnect.com/walletconnect-logo.png'],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'flutterdapp://',
      universal: 'https://www.walletconnect.com',
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Network selection or direct wallet connection

You can choose either to enable **Connect Wallet** button only after selecting a network (default behaviour) or to not display a **Select Network** button and directly navigate users to connect a wallet.

If you decide to take first approach of showing a `W3MNetworkSelectButton` **and** `W3MConnectWalletButton` (which is enabled only after selecting a Network) you simple have to add these two buttons on your code:

For instance:
```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    W3MNetworkSelectButton(service: _w3mService),
    W3MConnectWalletButton(service: _w3mService),
  ],
),
```
and `W3MConnectWalletButton` will handle it's state automatically.

But, as mentioned before, you can decide to just show the **Connect Wallet** button alone, in this case you would need to set it's state to `ConnectButtonState.none` like so:
```dart
W3MConnectWalletButton(
  service: _w3mService,
  state: ConnectButtonState.none,
),
```
this way `W3MConnectWalletButton` will be always enabled.
