**The Web3Modal SDK for Flutter is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

It's public API and associated documentation may still see significant and breaking changes.
:::

With Web3Modal Flutter, you can easily let people interact with multiple EVM compatible wallets and blockchains.

Letâ€™s get started with the installation and configuration!

<CloudBanner />

## Installation

Run the following command in your flutter project:

```bash
flutter pub add web3modal_flutter
```

## Implementation

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:web3modal_flutter/web3modal_flutter.dart';
```

Create your `W3MService` which is your primary class for opening, closing, disconnecting, etc.

Be sure to update the project ID and metadata with your own.

```dart
final _w3mService = W3MService(
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Flutter Dapp Example',
    description: 'Flutter Dapp Example',
    url: 'https://www.walletconnect.com/',
    icons: ['https://walletconnect.com/walletconnect-logo.png'],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'flutterdapp://',
      universal: 'https://www.walletconnect.com',
    ),
  ),
  recommendedWalletIds: {
    'afbd95522f4041c71dd4f1a065f971fd32372865b416f95a0b1db759ae33f2a7',
    '38f5d18bd8522c244bdd70cb4a68e0e718865155811c043f052fb9f1c51de662',
    'c57ca95b47569778a828d19178114f4db188b89b763c899ba0be274e97267d96',
  },
);
await _w3mService.init();
```

Now you can use the `W3MConnectWalletButton` or `W3MNetworkSelectButton` widget:

```dart
W3MConnectWalletButton(service: _w3mService)
// OR
W3MNetworkSelectButton(service: _w3mService)
```

Once session is approved you can use `W3MAccountButton` widget to show basic account data and to open Account data modal:

```dart
W3MAccountButton(service: _w3mService)
```
