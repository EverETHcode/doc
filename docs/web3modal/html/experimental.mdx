# EIP-6963 - Multi Injected Provider Discovery

The [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) standard is an alternative discovery mechanism to `window.ethereum` for wallets and web applications.

- It removes conflicts that may arise when having multiple browser extension wallets installed.
- Wallets inject their names and icons in addition to their providers, allowing them to automatically appear on the Web3Modal interface.

:::caution
This feature is experimental

You can add Web3Modal's EIP-6963 connector as part of your custom Wagmi setup

```ts
import { EIP6963Connector } from '@web3modal/wagmi'

createConfig({
  connectors: [
    new WalletConnectConnector({ chains, options: { projectId, showQrModal: false, metadata } }),
    /* highlight-add-start */
    new EIP6963Connector({ chains }), // <-- Add new connector
    /* highlight-add-end */
    new InjectedConnector({ chains, options: { shimDisconnect: true } }),
    new CoinbaseWalletConnector({ chains, options: { appName: 'Web3Modal' } })
  ]
  // ...
})
```

You can find a list of supported wallets and a demo of EIP-6963 at https://eip6963.org/
